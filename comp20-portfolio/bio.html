        <p>I was born in Glendale, CA, a year after my family had moved there from Japan. My father is a world-renowned neurosurgeon who has pioneered the field of micro-neurosurgery. My mother, though a homemaker, is kind and sharp-witted with an impeccable taste to match. I also have an older brother eight years above me who loves both art and physics equally. Currently, he is pursuing a career in medicine. While my father globe-trots around the world to save patients from all cultures and backgrounds, my mother and brother patiently wait back at our home in Los Angeles with our three dogs, one cat, one bird, and the squirrels that live in our backyard.</p>
        <p>Due to our father's career ambitions, our family had to move across the country many times. We have lived in California, Pennsylvania, Florida, and then returned once more to California. Massachusettes is now the fourth state I have lived in. I truly do love the cycles of seasonal atmospheres I experience here.</p>
        <p>I also figure skated competitively for about eight to ten years. In order to accomodate my rigorous training schedule, I had to withdraw from conventional education. My parents enrolled me instead in various homeschooling programs, through which I learned the skills and value of self-teaching. Though many people had high hopes for me, I ultimately decided that figure skating was not the path I wanted to follow, and eventually re-enrolled in a regular school in the tenth grade. I still appreciate to this day, though, the many lessons and experiences those years of figure skating had imparted to me.</p>
        <p>Aside from skating recreationally now, I'm also an avid big-mountain and backcountry skier. Thanks to a friend, I've also recently gotten into hiking and hope I have more chances to go in the near future. Other interests and hobbies of mine include dancing, taking walks, and exploring new places. I also like to stay in and watch movies and TV shows with my friends or family.</p>
        <p>In general, I'm interested in stories. The stories people have to tell, the stories in music and media, the power of stories, whether real or fictitous, to prompt introspection, to foster understanding, to inspire change, to connect people. I have this strange belief that stories can help save the world. So my dream is to someday travel the world, meet all kinds of people, have all sorts of experiences, and create stories from those adventures. And I hope, through my efforts, even if only slightly, to bring the world together into a kinder, more compassionate place.</p>
